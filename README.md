This is a simulation that will help with a mission to Mars!

The mission is to send a list of items (Habitats, bunkers, food supplies, and rovers) to Mars, but we need to run some simulations first to pick the correct fleet of rockets.

There are two types o rockets:
- U1 - can weight 10 tonnes of cargo
- U2 - can weight 18 tonnes of cargo

The cargo is:
- Habitats
-bunkers
- food supplies
- rovers

There are two mission phases.

The program calculates the cost of mission that uses u1 and u2 rockets separately.
